# Marey Realism V1.5

> Generate a video starting from an image as the first frame with Marey, a generative video model trained exclusively on fully licensed data.


## Overview

- **Endpoint**: `https://fal.run/moonvalley/marey/i2v`
- **Model ID**: `moonvalley/marey/i2v`
- **Category**: image-to-video
- **Kind**: inference


## API Information

This model can be used via our HTTP API or more conveniently via our client libraries.
See the input and output schema below, as well as the usage examples.


### Input Schema

The API accepts the following input parameters:


- **`prompt`** (`string`, _required_):
  The prompt to generate a video from
  - Examples: "Detailed Description: In a hidden jungle grotto, a majestic waterfall plunges into a dark, serene pool below. Ethereal sunbeams slice through the dense canopy high above, illuminating the swirling mist generated by the powerful cascade. The light rays dance across the scene, highlighting the vibrant green foliage that clings to the dark, wet rock walls. The constant roar of the falling water echoes through the secluded space, as the surface of the pool ripples and churns from the impact, creating a mesmerizing display of nature's raw power and tranquil beauty. Background: Brilliant sunbeams pierce through an opening in the dense jungle canopy, their ethereal rays shifting and shimmering as they cut through the misty air. Middleground: A powerful column of white water cascades down a dark, foliage-covered cliff face, creating a stark contrast with the shadowy recesses of the grotto. Foreground: The waterfall crashes into a dark, churning pool of water, sending up a fine spray and creating ever-expanding ripples across the surface."

- **`dimensions`** (`DimensionsEnum`, _optional_):
  The dimensions of the generated video in width x height format. Default value: `"1920x1080"`
  - Default: `"1920x1080"`
  - Options: `"1920x1080"`, `"1080x1920"`, `"1152x1152"`, `"1536x1152"`, `"1152x1536"`

- **`duration`** (`DurationEnum`, _optional_):
  The duration of the generated video. Default value: `"5s"`
  - Default: `"5s"`
  - Options: `"5s"`, `"10s"`

- **`negative_prompt`** (`string`, _optional_):
  Negative prompt used to guide the model away from undesirable features. Default value: `"<synthetic> <scene cut> low-poly, flat shader, bad rigging, stiff animation, uncanny eyes, low-quality textures, looping glitch, cheap effect, overbloom, bloom spam, default lighting, game asset, stiff face, ugly specular, AI artifacts"`
  - Default: `"<synthetic> <scene cut> low-poly, flat shader, bad rigging, stiff animation, uncanny eyes, low-quality textures, looping glitch, cheap effect, overbloom, bloom spam, default lighting, game asset, stiff face, ugly specular, AI artifacts"`

- **`seed`** (`integer`, _optional_):
  Seed for random number generation. Use -1 for random seed each run. Default value: `9`
  - Default: `9`

- **`image_url`** (`string`, _required_):
  The URL of the image to use as the first frame of the video.
  - Examples: "https://d1kaxrqq3vfrw5.cloudfront.net/fal-launch-assets/guide-assets/fal-i2v-example-input.png"

```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "moonvalley/marey/i2v",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "Detailed Description: In a hidden jungle grotto, a majestic waterfall plunges into a dark, serene pool below. Ethereal sunbeams slice through the dense canopy high above, illuminating the swirling mist generated by the powerful cascade. The light rays dance across the scene, highlighting the vibrant green foliage that clings to the dark, wet rock walls.

    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("moonvalley/marey/i2v", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Detailed Description: In a hidden jungle grotto, a majestic waterfall plunges into a dark, serene pool below.
