   }'
```

### Python

Ensure you have the Python client installed:

```bash
pip install fal-client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```python
import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/kling-video/v2.1/master/image-to-video",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "Sunlight dapples through budding branches, illuminating a vibrant tapestry of greens and browns as a pair of robins meticulously weave twigs and mud into a cradle of life, their tiny forms a whirlwind of activity against a backdrop of blossoming spring.  The scene unfolds with a gentle, observational pace, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the intricate details of nest construction, the soft textures of downy feathers contrasted against the rough bark of the branches, the delicate balance of strength and fragility in their creation.",
        "image_url": "https://v3.fal.media/files/zebra/9Nrm22YyLojSTPJbZYNhh_image.webp"
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript

Ensure you have the JavaScript client installed:

```bash
npm install --save @fal-ai/client
```

Then use the API client to make requests:

```javascript
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/kling-video/v2.1/master/image-to-video", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Sunlight dapples through budding branches, illuminating a vibrant tapestry of greens and browns as a pair of robins meticulously weave twigs and mud into a cradle of life, their tiny forms a whirlwind of activity against a backdrop of blossoming spring.  The scene unfolds with a gentle, observational pace, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the intricate details of nest construction, the soft textures of downy feathers contrasted against the rough bark of the branches, the delicate balance of strength and fragility in their creation.",
    image_url: "https://v3.fal.media/files/zebra/9Nrm22YyLojSTPJbZYNhh_image.webp"
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);
```
